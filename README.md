This repository showcases the implementation of various reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms applied to the CartPole environment from OpenAI's Gym. The CartPole problem is a fundamental benchmark in RL, where the objective is to balance a pole on a moving cart by applying forces to the left or right.
This is implemented using OpenAI gym and makes use of simple PPO algorithm for training the RL agent to perform the task well.
